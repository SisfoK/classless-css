        e.V. is a registered non-profit association based in Berlin, Germany. You don't have to be a member of
        the association in order to join Codeberg.org or to contribute to the development of the platform, but if you
        want you can join Codeberg e.V. to support the project financially, be informed about Codeberg and, optionally,
        to actively contribute to the association.

    <h2>Judul 2</h2>

    <section>
      <p>
        Codeberg is not the only libre option for hosting Free Software project. We don't aim for a vendor-lock-in, but
        hope you like our space and stay here.

        We recommend choosing a shared instance to save time, money and energy, ideally run by a community of people
        (like Codeberg). By choosing a Forgejo instance, you can easily migrate away from Codeberg in case you don't
        like it.

    <h3>Judul 3</h3>

    <section>
      <p>
        Forgejo is self-hostable free software for software development, built on top of Git. Codeberg is powered by
        Forgejo, which is in turn a soft-fork of Gitea. Compared to Codeberg, Forgejo is not one service, but free
        software to help you build your own. Everyone can install their own Forgejo instance to host their own projects.
        There are also public Forgejo instances as well as Codeberg you can use, but make sure you find a site that is
        actively maintained and updated, and that you trust the provider.

    <h4>Judul 4</h4>

    <section>
      <p>
        The development of Free and Open Source Software is experiencing an unbroken boom, due to the general
        availability of the internet and the resulting social network effects, multiplying communication, exchange of
        ideas, and productivity each and every month. The number of developers and projects participating in the Open
        Source movement is growing exponentially. Only new software tools and collaboration platforms made these
        dynamics possible and manageable.

      <h3>Paragraph</h3>
      <p>
        While all successful software tools that enabled this development were contributed by the Free and Open Source
        Software community, commercial for-profit platforms dominate the hosting of the results of our collaborative
        work. This has led to the paradox that literally millions of volunteers create, collect, and maintain invaluable
        knowledge, documentation, and software, to feed closed platforms driven by commercial interests, whose program
        is neither visible nor controllable from outside. Considering the fate of formerly successful startups like
        SourceForge, we need to break the circle and avoid history repeating.
